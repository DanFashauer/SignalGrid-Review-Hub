# SignalGrid build backlog

A living, prioritized backlog for continued build — human- or agent-driven.
Each item is scoped to ship as one reviewable PR. Ground rules for any agent
picking these up:

- **Public-safe by default** — no secrets, PHI/PII, tenant data, or live vendor
  calls; no production-ready / compliance / partnership / replacement claims.
- **Fail closed & fixture-first** — deterministic seeds; high-risk actions stay
  approval-gated and simulated.
- **Prove it** — every substantive change lands with a passing proof/test and
  `pnpm run typecheck` + `pnpm run safety:check` green.
- **One PR per item** — open for review; do **not** auto-merge.

## Now (next up)

- [ ] **Retail + industrial tenants in the core** — seed two more demo tenants so
      the retail (POS / restricted-sale) and industrial (MES / SCADA-HMI) app
      catalogs gate live, not catalog-only. Same pattern as the Meridian add.

## Next

- [ ] **In-app step-up loop (embedded, native prompt)** — when
      `/v1/app-workflows/evaluate` returns `step_up`, the *host app* drives the
      platform's native authenticator (Face ID / badge tap) via the hardened
      WebAuthn path and re-requests, held actions releasing — no SignalGrid screen.
      Governed by `docs/EMBEDDED_UX_PRINCIPLE.md`.
- [ ] **Reconcile the end-user surface with the embedded-UX law** —
      `artifacts/signalgrid-mobile-pwa` ("My Access") is a SignalGrid-branded
      end-user screen, which violates "the end user never opens SignalGrid."
      Reframe it as a reference host-app embedding demo, or an operator/support
      view — not a worker destination. See `docs/EMBEDDED_UX_PRINCIPLE.md`.
- [ ] **Per-integration workflow templates** — a starter catalog an integrator
      clones per app, plus a validation lint.

## Later / vision

_(see `docs/APP_WORKFLOWS_OPPORTUNITY_MAP.md` for the full app-workflow roadmap)_

## Done (recent)

- [x] App-workflow gating (`@workspace/app-workflows`) — SignalGrid now gates
      APPLICATION actions, not just physical ones: an app calls it before a
      sensitive action and gets back which of its actions may run automatically
      vs. which must be human-confirmed (Assist model), from a live decision.
      Catalog spans five verticals (healthcare EMR/BCMA/messaging/alarms;
      warehouse WMS/labor; industrial MES-HMI; fleet TMS/ELD/telematics; retail
      POS/restricted). New `GET /v1/app-workflows/integrations` +
      `POST /v1/app-workflows/evaluate` (OpenAPI + Postman), an "App workflows"
      admin page with live per-vertical gating, and `docs/APP_WORKFLOWS_OPPORTUNITY_MAP.md`.
      Proof: app-workflows 31/31 (incl. real-core EMR/BCMA end-to-end), api test 106/106.

- [x] Operational-intelligence rollups (Phase 3) — `operationalIntelligence()`
      on the control plane derives friction hotspots (from ingested telemetry),
      posture/config drift (nodes behind target bundle), and custody gaps
      (unreachable/degraded or stale-sync nodes) across sites, tenant-scoped.
      Exposed at `GET /cp/v1/ops-intelligence` (OpenAPI + Postman) and surfaced
      as a three-panel card on the admin Fleet page. Proof: control-plane 23/23.

- [x] Attestation verification — registration now verifies the attestation
      STATEMENT, not just the credential key. `none` (self-attested) is accepted;
      `packed` and `fido-u2f` are cryptographically verified (authData ||
      SHA-256(clientDataJSON), self- or x5c-attestation); any other format or a
      bad signature is refused (fail-closed). Proof: webauthn-verify 14/14
      (valid packed accepted; forged sig, alg/key mismatch, unsupported format,
      malformed none, malformed fido-u2f all rejected).

- [x] Global-fleet scenario pack — a third vertical (Meridian) added to the core
      seed and the Trusted-Entry runner + console: vehicle-mount field session and
      cross-region regulated-cargo checkout, across the full allow / step-up /
      restrict / deny spectrum. Fleet orchestration catalog (vehicle unlock,
      mount session, TMS route, cargo seal, dispatcher co-sign) + dispatcher
      confirmation language, cross-tenant fail-closed. Proof: room-sim 39/39,
      orchestration 40/40, core 166/166.

- [x] Warehouse scenario pack — the Trusted-Entry runner + on-device console now
      span two verticals: smart-hospital (Northwind) and warehouse (Atlas), with
      pick-aisle and controlled high-value/hazmat cage scenarios across the full
      allow / step-up / restrict / deny spectrum. Domain-aware orchestration
      catalog (zone gate, handheld, WES/WMS task, cage, supervisor witness) +
      confirmation language, cross-tenant fail-closed. Proof: room-sim 22/22,
      orchestration 35/35. (Also fixed a pre-existing api-contract parser bug
      where `/cp/v1/*` methods leaked onto the last `/v1` path.)

- [x] Per-vertical policy bundles surfaced in the admin Fleet UI — each tenant
      shows its signed bundle version + the workflow set it distributes
      (healthcare: clinical-session/med-admin; warehouse: pick-pack/controlled-area;
      global-fleet: field-session/vehicle-checkout). Reads `/api/cp/v1/policy-bundle`.

- [x] Signed policy bundles — config-down bundle is HMAC-signed (authenticity)
      on top of the checksum (integrity); edge verifies signature before applying,
      fail-closed on a checksum-valid forgery. Proofs updated (edge-sync 15/15,
      control-plane 17/17).

- [x] Telemetry-up wiring — real /v1 core decisions aggregated and ingested into
      the control-plane rollup (proof:telemetry-up, 7/7).
- [x] `/cp/v1` documented in the OpenAPI spec + Postman collection (with a
      lockstep coverage check for both `/v1` and `/cp/v1`).
- [x] Edge-sync contract proof — walks a node behind → synced (pull, verify
      checksum, reject tampered bundle fail-closed, apply, idempotent). 12/12.
- [x] Control-plane admin surface — "Fleet & tenants" page reading `/api/cp/v1/*`
      (rollup, per-vertical breakdown, edge-node sync + health across verticals).
- [x] SaaS control-plane scaffold (`@workspace/control-plane`) + `/cp/v1` routes
      + proof (3 verticals: healthcare / warehouse / global fleet).
- [x] WebAuthn step-up hardening (exact origin, User-Verification required).
- [x] Live `/v1` decision panel on the admin dashboard.
- [x] Admin console → api-server data layer; marketing site; deployment models;
      IGA adjacency; founder portfolio; multi-vertical narrative.
