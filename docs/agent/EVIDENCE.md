# Reviewer evidence log — claim → command → output

The `signalgrid-reviewer` role's only write path (with
`docs/agent/FALSE_CLAIMS.json`). Every entry is one verified claim: what was
claimed, the exact command run, and the output that confirms or refutes it.
Seeded empty at install (2026-08-22); the first review writes the first entry.
Format per entry:

```
## <date> — <claim, one sentence>
Command:  <exactly what was run>
Output:   <the relevant lines, verbatim>
Verdict:  holds | refuted (→ FALSE_CLAIMS.json) | not verifiable here (why)
```

## 2026-08-24 — "The ungated-fetch gate covers every outbound path in the connector tree"
Command:
```
cat >> lib/integrations/src/integrations/itsm/zendesk.ts <<'X'
export async function plantedUngated(u: string) {
  return fetch(u, { method: "POST" });
}
X
node scripts/check-ungated-fetch.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```
Output:
```
  connector files containing fetch: 88
  fetch call sites checked:         86
Ungated-fetch gate passed — no ungated healthCheck() remains.
exit=0
```
Verdict:  **refuted.** `itsm/` is one of four directories where a finding FAILS the
build, and the gate passed with an ungated `fetch` sitting in it. Scope was class
methods only (`if (start === -1 || !isClassMethod) continue`), while the stated
reason for that scope was external callability — which an exported top-level
function also has. Fixed in PR #297; backlog row 65.

## 2026-08-24 — "The fix catches the planted defect without flagging legitimate factories"
Command:
```
Z=lib/integrations/src/integrations/itsm/zendesk.ts
cp $Z /tmp/z.bak
run() { node scripts/check-ungated-fetch.mjs >/dev/null 2>&1; echo "  exit=$?"; }

# 1. the planted hole: exported, ungated, in an ENFORCED dir
cp /tmp/z.bak $Z
printf '\nexport async function plantedUngated(u: string) {\n  return fetch(u, { method: "POST" });\n}\n' >> $Z
run

# 2. control: identical body, NOT exported (internal plumbing, out of scope by design)
cp /tmp/z.bak $Z
printf '\nasync function privatePlumbing(u: string) {\n  return fetch(u);\n}\n' >> $Z
run

# 3. control: exported but carrying its own gate token
cp /tmp/z.bak $Z
printf '\nexport async function selfGated(u: string) {\n  const e = resolveEmission();\n  if (e.mode !== "live") return null;\n  return fetch(u);\n}\n' >> $Z
run

cp /tmp/z.bak $Z   # restore; `git status --porcelain -- $Z` must be empty
node scripts/check-ungated-fetch.mjs | tail -3
```
Output:
```
1. exported ungated fetch in enforced dir (expect 1):
  exit=1
2. non-exported plumbing (expect 0):
  exit=0
3. exported but self-gated (expect 0):
  exit=0
restored: (git status empty)

clean tree:
  connector files containing fetch: 88
  fetch call sites checked:         85
Ungated-fetch gate passed — no ungated healthCheck() remains.
```
Verdict:  **holds.** All ~25 `makeDefault*Transport` factories clear automatically,
including `device-management-health/graph-transport.ts` whose resolver lives one
file over and is reached through the family `index.ts` source.

## 2026-08-24 — "telemetry/ and passkey-assurance are STILL NOT ENFORCED" (a comment in check-ungated-fetch.mjs)
Command:
```
grep -n "STILL NOT ENFORCED" -A 8 scripts/check-ungated-fetch.mjs
# then plant an exported ungated fetch in telemetry/fleetdm.ts
node scripts/check-ungated-fetch.mjs; echo "exit=$?"
```
Output:
```
362:    // STILL NOT ENFORCED ... telemetry/ and passkey-assurance ... stay visible here.
369-    const enforcedDir = /\/(itsm|siem|telemetry|passkey-assurance)\//.test(file);
...
planted in telemetry/ -> exit=1
```
Verdict:  **refuted.** The sentence sat seven lines above the line that made both
families fatal, and contradicted its own preceding bullet, which already listed
telemetry/ as enforced. The enforced list is now derived from a named
`ENFORCED_DIRS` array and printed on every run. Backlog row 67.

## 2026-08-24 — "The ITSM credential store derives a 32-byte AES key" (true, and not the question)
Command:
```
# revert getEncryptionKey() to slice(0,32).padEnd(32,'0'), then:
pnpm run proof:itsm-credential-crypto
```
Output:
```
  FAIL — a human-typed password ('secret') is REFUSED, not padded to 32 bytes
  FAIL — a key one character under the 32-char floor is refused
  FAIL — two 64-char secrets sharing their first 32 chars derive DIFFERENT keys
  FAIL — derivation is SHA-256 of the secret, matching the sibling webhooks store
  FAIL — the IV is GCM's standard 12 bytes
FAIL — 16/21 checks
```
Verdict:  **refuted as a safety claim.** It produced 32 BYTES, not 32 bytes of
entropy: a short secret was stretched with ASCII zeros rather than refused, and a
64-hex secret lost half its entropy to the slice. LATENT, not live — the config
half of that store is wired to nothing. Fixed in PR #297; backlog row 66.

## 2026-08-24 — "The Fleet posture cache honours its own expiry"
Command:
```
# revert getPostureForHost to `return inMemoryPosture.get(key) ?? null`, then:
pnpm run proof:telemetry-posture-cache
```
Output:
```
  FAIL — an entry read AFTER its TTL returns null, not stale posture
  FAIL — a read that finds an expired entry EVICTS it rather than leaving it
FAIL — 17/19 checks
```
Verdict:  **refuted.** `expiresAt` was written at two sites and read at ZERO,
repository-wide. Redis expired its own keys via `EX`; the in-memory half — the
default path when `REDIS_URL` is unset — would have served stale posture forever.
The write is live and the read is dead, so nothing was served stale in practice.
Fixed in PR #297; backlog row 68.

## 2026-08-24 — "Six device-attestation reason codes are asserted in no proof"
Command:
```
for r in ATTESTED_SIP_DISABLED ATTESTED_KEXT_ALLOWED ...; do
  grep -rl "$r" scripts/src | grep -v evaluate.ts | wc -l
done
# then, the real test:
sed -i 's/reason: "ATTESTED_KEXT_ALLOWED"/reason: "ATTESTED_SECUREBOOT_REDUCED"/' \
  lib/integrations/src/integrations/device-attestation/evaluate.ts
pnpm run proof:device-attestation
```
Output:
```
grep: 0 files for six of eleven codes
baseline:  summary=pass (77/77)
mutant:    Exit status 1
```
Verdict:  **my claim refuted — NOT a defect.** Recorded so the next session does
not re-raise it.

CORRECTED 2026-08-24, after external review on PR #299 caught this entry stating
the wrong MECHANISM. It said the proof "asserts on posture/recommendedAction/
criticalFindings, not on the code strings". That is FALSE, and the conclusion
being right did not make the explanation harmless — an evidence log whose
reasoning is wrong teaches the next reader the wrong thing about coverage.

What is actually true:
```
scripts/src/device-attestation-proof.ts:72     v.reasonCode === spec.expected.reasonCode &&
scripts/fixtures/device-attestation/devices.json:22   "reasonCode": "ATTESTED_SECUREBOOT_REDUCED"
scripts/fixtures/device-attestation/devices.json:27   "reasonCode": "ATTESTED_KEXT_ALLOWED"
```
The proof is TABLE-DRIVEN and compares `reasonCode` directly against a fixture
that pins both codes. The mutation dies because the codes are fixture-backed —
not because some other field happened to catch it.

And the reason my grep returned zero is now exact, which is the part worth
keeping: the codes live ONLY in `scripts/fixtures/`, and I searched
`scripts/src`. A narrow search over the wrong subtree — the precise failure
`pnpm run check:absence` exists to prevent, which I did not run before asserting
absence.

## 2026-08-24 — "credential-exposure escalates on highValue only, ignoring severity"
Command:
```
grep -n "highValue" lib/integrations/src/integrations/credential-exposure/*.ts
```
Output:
```
credential-connector.ts:160:  highValue: HIGH_VALUE_KINDS.has(kind)
                              || severity === "critical" || severity === "high",
```
Verdict:  **my claim refuted — NOT a defect.** Severity is folded into `highValue`
at NORMALIZATION, so a critical secret does escalate; the comment is accurate and
the code implements it one layer up. This was the third hypothesis of the day with
the same shape — reading an evaluator in isolation and assuming its input was raw.
This codebase does the fail-closed work at the normalization boundary so the
evaluator can stay simple, and a grep across one layer cannot see that.

## NOT VERIFIED HERE (as of 2026-08-24)

Not an evidence record — no claim, command or verdict. Deliberately headed so the
entry counter cannot mistake it for one; coverage gaps are findings, and they are
reported separately rather than padding the entry count.
- **iOS / Swift behaviour.** No Xcode in this environment. Backlog row 58 (the
  Swift analogue of the NaN fail-open) remains open and is owed by the Mac lane.
- **`validate-sim-macos.sh` on real macOS.** This lane runs `preflight.mjs`; the
  harness under bash 3.2 on arm64 is the Mac lane's surface.
- **GitHub Pages source setting.** The REST call returns 403 through this
  environment's proxy; the branch-based-Jekyll conclusion was reached from served
  artifacts (a `?v=` stylesheet hash resolving to a real commit, `/README.md`
  returning 200, no `_config.yml`, no `gh-pages` branch), not from the API.

## 2026-08-24 — "A 403 from the GitHub API is always a permission finding"
Command:
```
# CI, PR #303, job "Typecheck, build, and proof scaffold", re-run after an
# unrelated E2E flake:
node scripts/check-ci-liveness.mjs
```
Output:
```
  ✗ could not reach the GitHub Actions API: GET /repos/DanFashauer/SignalGrid-Review-Hub/
    actions/workflows/scheduled-verification.yml/runs?per_page=10&status=completed
    -> 403 rate limit exceeded
      In CI this is FATAL.
```
Verdict:  **refuted, and it was my own arm.** Earlier the same day I gave this gate a
bounded retry and wrote that 401/403/404 "must surface on the first attempt rather than
being buried under three retries". True for a token lacking `actions: read` — and GitHub
also returns 403 for a SECONDARY RATE LIMIT, which is as transient as the 429 the same
commit made retryable. The arm added to keep permission findings honest reintroduced the
cry-wolf failure the retry existed to prevent.

The status alone cannot separate them, so the BODY decides: a 403 saying "rate limit",
"secondary rate" or "abuse detection", or carrying an exhausted-quota header, is
retried; every other 403 still fails on the first attempt. Positive evidence only — an
empty or unreadable body stays permanent, because guessing "probably a rate limit" would
bury the `actions: read` finding.

Falsified in BOTH directions, which is the part that matters for a discriminator:
```
classifier forced FALSE -> 3 checks fail, incl. "a rate-limit BODY marks a 403 retryable"
classifier forced TRUE  -> 3 checks fail, incl. "a PERMISSION 403 stays permanent"
restored                -> self-test green
```

## 2026-08-24 — "The E2E failure on PR #303 was caused by this branch"
Command:
```
pnpm --filter @workspace/scripts exec playwright test --config playwright.config.ts \
  --tsconfig ../tsconfig.base.json src/e2e/workflow-safety.spec.ts
pnpm run test:e2e            # the full suite, full concurrency
pnpm --filter @workspace/api-server run test:api
```
Output:
```
3 passed (28.7s)        # including the exact spec CI failed on
53 passed (57.3s)       # E2E_EXIT=0
API integration test: 301/301 assertions passed
```
Verdict:  **not reproducible here — reported as such, not as "fixed".** CI failed one of
53 E2E tests (`workflow-safety.spec.ts:37`, a `/cp/v1/grid/config` status check); the
same spec and the whole suite pass locally on the same tree, and the api-server suite is
301/301. The re-run then failed on the unrelated 403 above rather than repeating it,
so the E2E failure has been observed ONCE and never reproduced. Recorded as an
unexplained single occurrence, not as a flake I have proven.
