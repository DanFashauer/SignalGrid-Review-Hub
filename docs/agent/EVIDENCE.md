# Reviewer evidence log — claim → command → output

The `signalgrid-reviewer` role's only write path (with
`docs/agent/FALSE_CLAIMS.json`). Every entry is one verified claim: what was
claimed, the exact command run, and the output that confirms or refutes it.
Seeded empty at install (2026-08-22); the first review writes the first entry.
Format per entry:

```
## <date> — <claim, one sentence>
Command:  <exactly what was run>
Output:   <the relevant lines, verbatim>
Verdict:  holds | refuted (→ FALSE_CLAIMS.json) | not verifiable here (why)
```
